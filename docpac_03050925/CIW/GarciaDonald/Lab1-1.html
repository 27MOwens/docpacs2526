        <hr>

        <h1>NOTES:</h1>
        <h2>Prompt</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>I think they need to under stand both design and interactivity because you can't have one without the other when it comes to a language like JavaScript. All websites have HTML as the structure, and JavaScript is what gives those websites the ability to have people interact with the website.</li>
            <li>The examples that i can think of are streaming service websites (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Spotify, etc.) , social media websites (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) and online shopping sites such as Amazon & Ebay.</li>
        </ol>
